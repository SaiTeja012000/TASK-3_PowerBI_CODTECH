# DESCRIPTION : Power BI Project: Prime Video Analysis

In this project, I used Power BI to analyze and visualize key performance metrics for Prime Video, focusing on user engagement, content performance, and subscription trends. I began by gathering and cleaning data from multiple sources, including viewership logs, subscription reports, and content metadata. Using Power Query, I transformed raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis, ensuring consistency and accuracy.

Throughout the project, I focused on clear data storytelling by choosing effective visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and heat maps. I ensured that each report page had a logical flow, highlighting actionable insights for decision-makers. I also optimized the dashboard for performance by reducing query load and enabling incremental data refresh.

The final deliverable helped business stakeholders identify high-performing content, understand audience preferences, and make data-driven decisions for content acquisition and marketing strategies. I presented the report to non-technical audiences, explaining insights and answering questions to support strategic planning.
